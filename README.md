# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction using XGBoost

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting hotel booking cancellations using **XGBoost**, a powerful ensemble learning algorithm. By analyzing historical booking data, we aim to develop a predictive model that helps hotels optimize their operations, manage overbooking, and improve revenue management.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features related to hotel bookings, including:
- **Booking details** (arrival date, lead time, etc.)
- **Customer demographics** (market segment, country, etc.)
- **Hotel information** (hotel type, number of nights, etc.)
- **Previous cancellations and rebooking history**

## Model Performance
The model is evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**: Measures overall correctness
- **Precision & Recall**: Balances false positives and false negatives
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provides insights into misclassifications
